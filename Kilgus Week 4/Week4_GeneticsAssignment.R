# What happens to the maximum parsimony calculation when you move a node in the unrooted tree from this week's exercise? (4 points)
  # Use the term "similarity matrix" in your answer.
  # Hint: Why does it take longer to calculate than the original tree, and even more so if you move the point further?


# For your scripting assignment we will use the "ge_data" data frame found in the "stability" package.
  # Install the "stability" package, load it into your R environment, and use the data() function to load the "ge_data". 

# Create two linear models for Yield Response: one related to the Environment and one to the Genotype.
  # 'Yield Response' in this dataset is a measure of phenotype expression.
  # Hint: Look at the help file for this dataset.

# Test the significance of both models and look at the model summary.
  # Which model is a better fit to explain the yield response, and WHY? (4 points)
    # Hint: Does one model seem more likely to be over-fitted?

# Which environment would be your very WORST choice for generating a strong yeild response? (2 points)
