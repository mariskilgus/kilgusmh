#Question: How do antibiotics effect greenhouse emissions from cows?
#Data: Cows that were treated with penicillin intramammary, penicillin intramuscularly, tetracycline intramuscularly, and control. Total Greenhouse emissions over the course of 14 weeks per treatments.
#Figures: Box plot of control Greenhouse emissions before, Boxplot of average of treated Greenhouse emissions after, and histogram of averages of control treatment and averages after treatment
#Data processing: Exclude milk production, averaging gasses emission for each treatment used over each of the 14 weeks, because there is not equal individuals per treatment.
